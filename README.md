# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

### 📌 Internship: Oasis Infobyte – Data Analytics Domain

### 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to predict wine quality based on its chemical characteristics using machine learning models like Random Forest, SVC, and SGD Classifier.

---

### 🧩 Dataset
- **Name:** WineQT.csv  
- **Attributes:** Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, Citric acid, Residual sugar, Chlorides, Sulphates, Alcohol, pH, Density, etc.  
- **Target:** Wine Quality (Score between 0–10)

---

### ⚙️ Steps & Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Checked shape, columns, and statistical summary.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removed nulls, outliers, and standardized features.  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Scaled and selected relevant chemical parameters.  
4. **Model Training:** Used Random Forest, SGD, and SVC classifiers.  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Compared model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.  
6. **Visualization:** Correlation heatmap, boxplots, and quality distribution.

---

### 📈 Results & Insights
- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (~90%).  
- Alcohol content, sulphates, and volatile acidity were the strongest predictors.  
- Moderate wines dominated the dataset (Quality 5–6).
